# PHPUnit-GitHub-CI-Example :rocket:

## About the Project :book:

"PHPUnit-GitHub-CI-Example" offers a clear-cut introduction to unit testing with PHPUnit and Continuous Integration (CI) via GitHub Actions. Ideal for beginners, this PHP application serves as a gateway into the world of automated testing and CI/CD within the PHP ecosystem.

## How It Works :gear:

Comprising basic PHP scripts like `index.php` and `footer.php`, the application showcases fundamental PHP capabilities. Within the `tests/` directory, you'll find PHPUnit test files specifically crafted to validate the functionality of these scripts. GitHub Actions are integrated to automatically execute these tests with each code push, ensuring the integrity and reliability of the code.

## Getting Started :beginner:

Embark on your journey with "PHPUnit-GitHub-CI-Example" by cloning it to your local machine. This step will give you firsthand experience with PHPUnit and GitHub Actions, two pivotal tools in modern PHP development.

### Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you have the following installed:

- PHP (Preferably the latest version)
- Composer, a PHP dependency manager. Composer helps manage dependencies for PHP projects and can be installed from [getcomposer.org](https://getcomposer.org/).

### Installation :wrench:

1.  **Clone the repository**:
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/Superv1sor/PHPUnit-GitHub-CI-Example.git
    ```
2.  **Navigate to the project directory**:
    ```bash
    cd PHPUnit-GitHub-CI-Example
    ```
3.  **Install dependencies** using Composer:
    ```bash
    composer install
    ```
4.  **Run the tests** to see PHPUnit in action:
    ```bash
    vendor/bin/phpunit
    ```

## Experimenting and Learning :bulb:

This project is designed as a hands-on learning tool for understanding Test-Driven Development (TDD) in PHP. Feel free to clone the repository, play around with the code, and run the tests. It's a great way to see TDD and GitHub Actions in action!

### Suggestions for Your Experiments

- Add new functions to the PHP files and create corresponding tests in the `tests` directory.
- Experiment with modifying the PHPUnit tests to understand how assertions work.
- Explore the GitHub Actions workflow to see how automated testing is integrated into CI/CD processes.

## Uploading to GitHub for CI :cloud:

**Getting your project onto GitHub is the first step towards harnessing the power of Continuous Integration.** This section guides you through initializing your local repository, committing your project files, and pushing everything to a new GitHub repository. These steps are crucial for setting up GitHub Actions in the next phase.

### Initializing Git

1.  **Initialize a Git repository** in your project directory.

    ```bash
    git init
    ```

2.  **Add your files and commit**:
    ```bash
    git add .
    git commit -m "Initial commit"
    ```

### Pushing to GitHub

1.  **Create a new repository on GitHub**. You can name it whatever you like; for instance, `PHPUnit-GitHub-CI-Example` or any other name that reflects your project's purpose.

2.  **Link your local repository to GitHub**:
    ```bash
    git remote add origin https://github.com/your-username/your-repo-name.git
    git push -u origin main
    ```
    Replace `your-username` with your GitHub username and `your-repo-name` with the name of the repository you just created. This links your local project with the remote repository on GitHub and pushes your initial commit.

## Continuous Integration with GitHub Actions :arrows_counterclockwise:

**With your project now on GitHub, it's time to automate your testing process using GitHub Actions.** This powerful tool automatically runs your tests every time you push new code, ensuring that your project remains stable and error-free. Below, you'll find instructions on setting up a CI workflow and how to view its results.

### Setting Up the CI Workflow

1.  **Create a workflow file** in your repository under `.github/workflows`, e.g., `ci.yml`.

2.  **Define the CI process** in the workflow file. This should include steps to install PHP, Composer dependencies, and run PHPUnit tests.

### Viewing CI Results

After pushing changes to your repository, navigate to the "Actions" tab on GitHub to see the results of your CI workflow.

## Congratulations on Your Journey! :tada:

**You've made significant strides in exploring the world of automated testing and CI with PHP.** By reaching this point, you've not only gained practical experience with PHPUnit and GitHub Actions but also taken important steps towards mastering modern software development practices.

This journey through "PHPUnit-GitHub-CI-Example" has hopefully ignited a passion for continuous learning and experimenting. Remember, the path of learning is endless, and there's always something new to discover and master in the ever-evolving landscape of software development.

### Keep Exploring and Growing :muscle:

- Continue to build upon what you've learned here.
- Share your experiences or insights with others.
- Dive deeper into more advanced topics of PHP, testing, and CI/CD.

Thank you for joining this adventure. May your future coding endeavors be fruitful and enjoyable!
